# LLM Agent-Based Conversational Data Simulation Platform
This repository holds all code artifacts related to my 5th year dissertation project at the University of Glasgow.

The title of the project is:
"Simulating Human Conversations: An LLM-based Approach to Synthetic Dialogue Generation and Evaluation"

## Project Overview

The goal of this project was to develop a flexible, open-source platform for simulating human-like conversations between Large Language Model (LLM) agents and evaluating the quality of the generated dialogue using an LLM-as-a-judge pipeline.

The platform enables:

- Custom persona-driven LLM agents to engage in multi-turn conversations.
- Generation of synthetic conversational datasets tailored to any topic.
- LLM-based automatic reference-free evaluation of conversation quality across four key metrics:
  - Persona-Consistency  
  - Context-Relevance  
  - Naturalness  
  - Fluency

It leverages zero-shot and in-context learning capabilities of open-source LLMs to ensure full model flexibility and cost-free generation for users.
